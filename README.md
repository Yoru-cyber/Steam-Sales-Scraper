# Steam Sales Bot ðŸ¤–
> This is a bot I made to get the current steam sales.

## Technical Implementation
This is a bot made with playwright that goes to different locations on the steam sales page like: trending, bestsellers and so goes on.
It searches the links of the products on the main page, it opens the page of the product and scrapes the name, the price on sale and the original price.
